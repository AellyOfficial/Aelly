### Using Docker locally

To follow this method, you will need to have docker installed on your machine and have some experience using docker.

To host the bot on your own device using docker, follow the following steps on your terminal / command prompt -

```bash
wget -O Aelly.tar.gz https://github.com/AellyOfficial/Aelly/archive/refs/tags/v2.0.0-beta.tar.gz
tar -xvzf Aelly.tar.gz
cd Aelly-2.0.0-beta
docker build -t Aelly .
docker run --rm --name Aelly Aelly
```

This will create a container running Aelly. You'll have to scan the QR at least once.

### The GNU/Linux Legacy Way

To use this method, you will need ffmpeg, nodejs, npm installed on your device.

To run the bot on your device manually, you can use the following commands -

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AellyOfficial/Aelly.git
cd Aelly
yarn
npm start
```

## Scan QR Code again
If you're having issues when running locally it is recommended to scan the code again. To get the QR code again, follow these commands -
```
rm -rf Aelly.db session.data.json
npm start
```
